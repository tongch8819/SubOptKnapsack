This module aims to compute data-dependent upperbound for Unconstrained Submodular Maximization with Modular Cost (USM-MC) problem.

We have two data-dependent upperbound method from Tang et al., 2018.

We could derive a new data-dependent upperbound from the result of Jin et al., 2021.


Conclusion:
mu1 is much better than mu2.
