# Submodular Optimization Experiment


This repository focuses on submodular maximization problems with knapsack constraints. Submodular functions are set functions that exhibit a natural diminishing returns property, making them suitable for various optimization tasks. The goal is to maximize these functions under given constraints, which is a common problem in fields like machine learning, economics, and operations research.
